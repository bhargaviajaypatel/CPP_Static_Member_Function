# CPP_Static_Member_Function
A static member is used to declare the global data which should be updated while the program lives in memory.
In C++, static is a keyword or modifier that belongs to the type not instance. A static function can have an access to only other static members (functions or variables) declared in same class. A static member is created and initialize once and shared among all class objects.
